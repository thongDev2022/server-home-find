Server Home Find is a backend API built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma to manage apartments, users, bookings, and payments. It provides a structured system where users can browse apartments, owners can list their properties, and admins can manage categories and booking status. This server is designed to be the backend for a home-finding or rental application, supporting authentication, CRUD operations, and integration with Postman for testing.
